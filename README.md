Blank HTML Template for development using The Bootstrap Library

jQuery and Popper?
    Bootstrap 4 use jQuery and Popper.js for JavaScript components (like modals, tooltips, popovers etc). 
    However, if you just use the CSS part of Bootstrap, you don't need them.

By adding these, this site can include Bootstrap JavaScript functionality
